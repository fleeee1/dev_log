# Learning Log

A journal of what I'm working on and learning as I grow into a software developer. I realize that I am frequently changing what I'm working on and diving into sub-projects that have other
sub-projects, etc. I want to document my journey to reflect some of these learning excursions.

- felt stuck working on personal web page as my design skills are raw. I just recently learned about wireframing and tried my hand at this with a pen and paper. This did help, but after beginning
the website, I realized that I still don't have a clear idea of where I'm going.
- today, I watched a video by designer Charlie Marie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2SQAF0ylso) and realized that perhaps learning Figma might help.
- subscribed to Charlie Marie's podcast
- started a YouTube tutorial on Figma, realized halfway in that it is several years old and is not lining up with what i'm seeing
- started a second YouTube Figma tutorial, from Design with Arash (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SNZRCVNizg)
